# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) Project
## Overview 
As AI continues to grow in popularity across nearly every industry, there has been a rising interest in leveraging machine learning for solving scientific and engineering problems. Traditional neural networks often require large datasets and fail to generalize well outside their training distributions, especially systems governed by complex partial differential equations.

From the foundational paper published by Maziar Raissi, Paris Perdikaris, and George Karniadakis, they introduced the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which provide a solution to this challenge and showed the effectiveness of this concept.
